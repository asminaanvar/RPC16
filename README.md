# 🌍 AirPure Innovations - AQI & Air Purifier Market Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
"AirPure Innovations" is a startup born out of the air quality crisis in India, where **14 cities rank among the world’s top 20 most polluted urban centers**.  
This project focuses on **analyzing air quality data, health impacts, vehicle usage, and population trends** to evaluate the **potential demand for air purifiers**.  
The goal was to help the startup make **data-driven product & market entry decisions** before launch.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
AirPure Innovations was uncertain whether there would be **strong and sustained demand** for air purifiers.  
To solve this, I worked as a **Data Analyst (Peter Pandey role)** and conducted an end-to-end analysis, covering:

- 🔎 **Severity Mapping** – Identifying cities with persistent/worsening AQI trends  
- 🏥 **Health Impact Correlation** – Linking AQI levels with public health patterns  
- 🚗 **Vehicle Impact Analysis** – Understanding pollution contribution from vehicles  
- 👥 **Population & Demand Triggers** – Relation of spikes in AQI to consumer adoption  
- 📈 **Google Trends + Market Research** – Insights into consumer interest & market potential

## 🛠️ Steps Followed
1. **Data Collection & Extraction** (Python / Pandas)  
   ✅ Validated and structured datasets from multiple sources  
   
2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** (Pandas)  
   ✅ Removed duplicates, handled null values, and normalized records  

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis & Visualization** (Power BI + Python)  
   ✅ Built **interactive dashboards** with KPIs, trend lines, and comparative insights  

---

## 📊 Key Insights
- **PM2.5 & PM10** are the most critical pollutants to target.  
- **Delhi, Ghaziabad, and Lucknow** show the **highest sustained demand** for air purifiers.  
- Consumer adoption increases sharply during **pollution spikes (seasonal trends)**.  
- **Smart connectivity + real-time AQI monitoring** are the most valued features by potential customers.  

---

## ✅ Conclusion
The analysis confirms a **strong market opportunity** for AirPure Innovations if they:  
- Focus R&D on **PM2.5/PM10 filtration efficiency**  
- Target **high-pollution cities first (Delhi NCR, Lucknow, Ghaziabad)**  
- Integrate **smart features** (real-time AQI monitoring, mobile connectivity)  

With these strategies, the startup can **position itself as a market leader** and directly address India’s urgent air quality crisis.
